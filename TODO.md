TODO / OPEN ISSUES:

- NIXVIM: which-key only in menu not inside file in normal mode
- SYS GUI/FONTS: the font in some gui popups (like asking for permission) is
  broken i see only rectangulars. Either we change the font to something we have
  installed, install the missing font, or just add some "default fonts"
